Implementation of Universal Set in C++ 
============================
* on templates 
* with an array from STL as a container
* with copy/move constructors and assignment operators
* with custom forward iterator and Vector class using std::bitset to mark whether element is inserted in the array or not

## Operations:
- function to get an element at certain position (also for overloaded operator[])
- function to create a Vector object
- size of the Universal Set

## Operations for Vector class:
- insertion 
- deletion
- find (function isMember)
- iterator for particular element
- count (number of elements)
- functions to check equality or inequality of sets
- functions to find union, intersection, relative complement and symmetric difference of sets
- iterators to begin and end

## Operations for custom iterator:
- comparison operators
- dereference operators
- preincrement and postincrement
- overloaded operator bool
